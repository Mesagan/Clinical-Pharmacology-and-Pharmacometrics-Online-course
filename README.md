# Clinical-Pharmacology-and-Pharmacometrics-Online-course
Learning to understanding the interaction between drugs and human body, and model such interactions.

## Lesson 1

In this lesson, we will learn the following highlights:
- The role of clinical pharmacology and pharmacometrics in clinical drug development
- Clinical drug development phases review
- Clinical pharmacological studies in clinical trials

## Objectives:
- Outline the drug discovery and clinical development process
- Understand selected topics in clinical trial design and execution with a focus on clinical pharmacology studies
- Determine the role played by pharmacometrics within drug development and pharmacotherapy
